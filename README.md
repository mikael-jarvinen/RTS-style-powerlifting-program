Makes RTS powerlifting programs based on the The Reactive Training Manual By Michael Tuscherer 

WpfApp2\bin\Release\    is only needed to use the program


RTS program consists of blocks
You can add a block by pressing the "Add Block" button and inserting needed parameters
Blocks are generated with weekly templates which you can modify by pressing the "Edit Weekly Template" button.
I recommend using my premade weekly templates, unless you have read RTS manual by Michael Tuscherer.


Exercises are almost randomly picked from exercise templates. Randomly because you shouldn't always do the same exercise, even small changes help.
You can add and remove exercises from the exercise templates by pressing the "Edit Template Exercises" button


When your program is done you can save it as an Excel file(.xlsx)



Do note that to understand the generated RTS style program you should have some knowledge about RTS.

Exercise parameters.
Behind an exercise you can see some parameters. 
RPE followed by a number, the number tells what RPE should you train with.
Number and '%' tells you what is your fatique percentage
"ld" and "ldg" stand for "load drop" and "load drop gradually", this is the protocol which you should use to achieve the desired fatique percentage
